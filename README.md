# ScriptJava
Java REPL today


There are a lot of benefits for a programming language to have a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). It helps one learn and explore the language features, gives ability to execute fast a code in question without launching IDE or modifiying existing project.



Writing *whole* Java code in command line seems like an overkill. Creating a class, then main method, then call to `System.out.print()` to execute such simple as `Integer.MAX_VALUE` command seems like a long way. What's why ScriptJava is *not* completely Java REPL. For example, semicolons(`;`) are *mostly* optional. There are a lot of *build-ins* methods, that can save a coder a few keyboard strokes. So, yeah, to know the value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` you just input `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

## Build-in functions
* **`bool()`** -> inspired by python's function. In short: `null`, `0`, or `""`(empty string) returns `false`. Defined in `Bool.java`
* **`len()`** - > inspired by python's function. Unifies calls to get length of different objects. Defined in `Length.java`
* **`str()`** - > returns *good* object representation as a String. Defined in `Str.java`. In case of a file (if exists) returns file contents as a String
* **`print()`** > do as expected. Accepts multiple objects: `print(1, 2, 3, 4)`. Every object's string representation will be obtained via `str()` call
* **`printf()`** -> Helper method to call `System.out.printf()`. Won't change the objects representation
* **`list()`** -> creates a list from supplied arguments, `list(1, 2, 3, 4)`
* **`map()`** -> original signature of this method is a bit scary: `map(String[] keys, Object[] values)`, but with the help of the substitution command becomes more friendly: `map(key1: 1, key2: 2)`
* **`bin()`** -> returns binary representation of an integer value
* **`hex()`** -> return hex representation of an integer value
* **`date()`** -> helper method to call `new Date()`
* **`now()`** -> helper method to call `System.currentTimeMillis()`
* **`exec()`** -> executes supplied command as a String in a different process, returns String (the process output): `exec("java -version")`
* **`file()`** -> this method has different signatures. Called without parameters returns current execution folder. Called with a String as a parameter -> constructs File object with specified path
* **`del()`** -> removes file, takes a File object or a path
* **`write()`** -> takes a File object and it's contents as a String. Will write contents to a file
* **`json()`** -> Super primitive json parser that returns `Element` with the following methods: `key(String)` -> retrieves an JSON object by the key; `at(int)` -> retrieves a value from JSON array at give index; `get()` -> returns JSON primitive. Please note that exception will be thrown if method called on wrong JSON type (for example `at` will be called on JSON object)
* **`get()`** -> executes GET http request, returns response as a String
* **`post()`** -> executes POST http request, returns response as a String
* **`range()`** -> creates a *range* of integers to be easily interated, `for (int i: range(10))`. Returns `int[]`. has 3 signatures: `range(end)`, `range(start, end)`, `range(start, end, step)`
* **`dict()`** -> returns object's meta info (class name, parent class name, implements), fields and values. Has ability to return also info about methods
* **`type()`** -> returns human readable Type info (redirects call to `str()`)
* **`toMap()`** -> converts an object into a `Map<String, Object>` (no recursive calls)
* **`fromMap()`** -> constructs an object from supplied `Map<String, Object>`
* **`set()`** -> tries to modify objects field given the name and value. Can modify `final` fields
* **`ni()`** -> simple call for `Class.newInstance()`
* **`store()`** -> stores a variable between script recompilations (actually can be useful only when removing previously retrieved value with `ret` call)
* **`ret()`** -> retirievs previously stored valiable or tries to obtain it if not present
* **`copy()`** -> copies supplied argument to the system clipboard and returns the value unmodified. `copy(exec("echo HelloThere | cowsay -e --"))` will copy result value of the `exec` call and print it.

Also, by default `java.util.Math` is statically imported, so **`pow()`**, **`sin()`**, **`cos()`**, etc are available

## Special commands
* **`import `** -> adds an import statement for a script, for example `import java.text.*`
* **`clean`** -> completely cleans script
* **`quit`** -> exits from REPL
* **`bytecode`** -> prints bytecode for current script (if `javap` is present in PATH)


## Substitutions
* **`map(key1: 1, key2: 2, key3: "some string")`** this (invalid in Java syntax) will be substituted new a call to build-in function map: `map(new String[] { "key1", "key2", "key3" }, new Object[] { 1, 2, "some string" })`
* **`ret("key", someCommand())`** -> will be sustituted with: `ret("key", new Provider() { Object provide() { return someCommand(); } })`. This is done to skip initialization command if value is already defined, else the Provider object will be called to retrieve the value

## Default imports
Except build-in functions these packages are imported by default:
* **`java.util.*`**
* **`java.text.*`**
* **`java.io.*`**

## Custom libraries
Right now if there is a folder called `libs` inside execution directory, all jars that are inside it will be added to the script class path. Anyway you still need to import desired class first (here is no surprices).

## Drawbacks
As we cannot achive completely *scripting* behavior from Java, there are certain things to be aware of. First, everytime you hit `Enter` the whole script is compiled from scratch. That's why all the variables will be set anew. For example:
```java
Date d = date() // hit Enter
d // will print the *current* date, not the date value, that we obtained earlier
```
There is a woraround for this: build-in function `ret`:
```java
Date d = ret("d", date())
d // will print the first obtained value
```

## Installation
Before launching the executable make sure, that there is `javac` in the system PATH. Most likely that you already have it there. Also, if you wish to use `bytecode` function (that prints Java bytecode of compiled script) make sure that there is also a `javap` in the PATH.


## Building
The main project has no dependencies, so it's a straight-forward process. 

Tests require `Gson` (for json testing)

build with ant :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noties/ScriptJava.git
cd ScriptJava
ant install
java -jar build/jar/ScriptJava.jar
```

enjoy it~
